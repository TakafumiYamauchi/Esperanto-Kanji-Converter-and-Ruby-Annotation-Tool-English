      "【Explanation of User-Defined Replacement Strings (Kanji)】",
      "Similar to the previously mentioned JSON (User-Defined Esperanto Word-Stemming Rules), the first three elements (word segmentation, priority, and suffixes) follow exactly the same specification method.",
      "In this JSON, the fourth element of each line defines your own user-specific replacement string.",
      "However, the number of segments separated by ‘❛/❜’ in the original word must match the number of segments separated by ‘❛/❜’ in the replacement string.",
      "If the number of segments does not match, note that the definition on that line will not be correctly loaded into the replacement list."
